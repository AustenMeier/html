# html course

## Section One Review

### Negatives
1. Under the Html Attributes it mentions the opening tag you might give a breif explaination of them there
2. for the <!--<img>--> and <!--<a>--> when I was doing the project I wasn't entirly sure of the attribute used with for the <!--<img>--> it was src and href for the <!--<a>-->
3. When you show the example for using Semantic Elements you might add a some more comments about what you're doing in the example

### Positives
1. I like the way the course is structured it's easy to read and i can get through it fairly quick  
2. The course covered some very important begining subject for html like attributes inline vs block and even mentioned where to code html(HTML Editors and Tools)
3. The examples were really good and fairly easy to understand

## Section Two Review

### Negatives
1. Before explaing why to use Semantic HTML you should have a section that explains in a little more detail what it is
2. In the project you should have them use <!--<section>--> to along with the other html tags
3. I think one was more my bad but when I was doing the project I used the <!--<li>--> wrong...  I'll put an example here below

<!-- "<header>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="index.html">home</a>
                    <a href="http://duolingo.com">Duolingo</a>
                    <a href="https://github.com">github</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>" -->

### Positives
1. Again from 1 and 2 structrued really well and goes over an important concept to html(Semantic HTML)
2. The example were pretty good and easy to understand
3. Explaining why to use semantic HTML and what it does was a great idea
