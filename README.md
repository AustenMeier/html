# html course

## Section 1 Review

### Negatives
1. Under the Html Attributes it mentions the opening tag you might give a breif explaination of them there
2. for the &lt;img&gt; and &lta&gt when I was doing the project I wasn't entirly sure of the attribute used with for the &lt;img&gt; it was src and href for the &lt;a&gt;
3. When you show the example for using Semantic Elements you might add a some more comments about what you're doing in the example

### Positives
1. I like the way the course is structured it's easy to read and i can get through it fairly quick  
2. The course covered some very important begining subject for html like attributes inline vs block and even mentioned where to code html(HTML Editors and Tools)
3. The examples were really good and fairly easy to understand

## Section 2 Review

### Negatives
1. Before explaing why to use Semantic HTML you should have a section that explains in a little more detail what it is
2. In the project you should have them use &lt;section&gt; to along with the other html tags
3. I think one was more my bad but when I was doing the project I used the &lt;li&gt; wrong...  I'll put an example here below

### Positives
1. Again from 1 and 2 structrued really well and goes over an important concept to html(Semantic HTML)
2. The example were pretty good and easy to understand
3. Explaining why to use semantic HTML and what it does was a great idea
4. I liked how some things kind of built off of section 1

## Section 3 Review

### Negatives
1. I think you forgot to mention that you can use &ltu&gt to generate underlined text 
2. for the Subscript and Superscript formatting you don't show how to create that in html

3. In the examples for lists and tables it'd be cool if you could describe what's happening a bit more in the example and what each tag does

4. I think you should add more exercises to each section maybe one in the middle and at the beggining you could have them review things from previous sections too

### Positives
1. structrued really well and goes over some cool formatting in html along with lists and tables
2. more specifically I like how structrued the "Text Formatting Examples" with an example of the formated and text and a description on how to create it in html
3. I liked the tips for lists and tables it'd be cool if you can fit that into other sections too
4. I liked how the project included things from previous projects

## Section 4 Review

### Negatives
1. Instead of just showin an example of a form you should go into more detail about what each attribute and element does
2. Probably leave out the javascript in this section also in the exercise you said to use javacript but I didn't see any in your example 
3. You should add a little more requirements in the exercise so the final version would have to look more like a webpage to meet the requirements

### Positives
1. structrued is nice and short 
2. It goes over imprtant atributes and User input elements 
3. Tries to build off from other sections
