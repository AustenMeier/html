# html course

## Section One Review

### Negatives
1. Under the Html Attributes it mentions the opening tag you might give a breif explaination of them there
2. for the <img> and <a> when I was doing the project I wasn't entirly sure of the attribute used with for the <img> it was src and href for the <a>
3. When you show the example for using Semantic Elements you might add a some more comments about what you're doing in the example

### Positives
1. I like the way the course is structured it's easy to read and i can get through it fairly quick  
2. The course covered some very important begining subject for html like attributes inline vs block and even mentioned where to code html(HTML Editors and Tools)
3. The examples were really good and fairly easy to understand
